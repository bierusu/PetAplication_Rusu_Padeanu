# ProgrammingEnvironments_CourseProject_part1

This GitHub repository showcases my first foray into programming with C# through a project developed in ASP.Net Razor Pages. Leveraging knowledge from my coursework, I've crafted a small web platform.

Contained within, you'll find:

⨂ C# Source Code: This forms the backbone of the platform, executed in ASP.Net Razor Pages. Trace my journey as a novice C# programmer through these scripts, mirroring my learning and adjustment to this new language.

⨂ Razor Pages: These are dynamically constructed web pages within the platform, demonstrating how back-end functionalities and front-end elements interplay to create a seamless, intuitive user experience.
